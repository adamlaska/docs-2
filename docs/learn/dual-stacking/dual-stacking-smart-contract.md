# Dual Stacking Smart Contract

## Overview

The Dual Stacking contract enables participants to earn boosted sBTC rewards by holding sBTC and optionally stacking STX. It operates in cycles with periodic snapshots to calculate rewards based on holdings and stacking participation.

{% hint style="info" %}
For the live dual stacking contract on mainnet, check out the contract page [here](https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/SP1HFCRKEJ8BYW4D0E3FAWHFDX8A25PPAA83HWWZ9.dual-stacking-v1?chain=mainnet).
{% endhint %}

### Decentralized Architecture

* Permissionless operations: Anyone can execute critical cycle operations including snapshot capturing, ratio proposal/validation, weight calculation, and reward distribution.
* On-chain data only: All participant data (sBTC balances, STX stacking amounts) is read directly from the blockchain — no off-chain oracles or trusted data sources required.
* Competitive ratio discovery: Multiple participants can propose different golden ratios; the system validates based on mathematical criteria (95th percentile), not admin approval.
* Transparent execution: All operations are executed on-chain with verifiable results and public event logs.
* Self-service enrollment: Users can enroll, opt-out, and manage their participation independently.

### Main Operations

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Initialization

The contract is initialized once with a Stacks block height parameter that is the first one in the Bitcoin block specified, or after it, in case there aren't any STX blocks anchored to it.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Enrollment

Users can self-enroll for participation with custom reward addresses. DeFi protocols can be enrolled by admin with custom tracking, stacking, and reward addresses. All participants can opt-out or change their addresses at any time.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Snapshots and Cycles

Anyone can trigger periodic snapshots that capture participant sBTC balances and STX stacking amounts from on-chain data based on predefined block intervals.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Ratio Computation

After snapshots are complete, anyone can propose a golden ratio (optimal STX/sBTC ratio), tally participant distributions, and validate if their proposal meets the 95th percentile criteria to determine the benchmark for maximum rewards.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Weight Calculation

Anyone can trigger participant weight calculations using the validated dual stacking formula that provides up to 10x boost (configurable) for those who meet or exceed the golden ratio.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Rewards

Anyone can trigger reward distribution every cycle based on calculated weights. Administrators can update configurations like APR, yield boost multiplier, snapshot length, and number of snapshots per cycle.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Administrative Controls

Admins maintain protocol parameters, enroll/opt-out DeFi protocols with special address configurations, manage whitelists and blacklists, and can perform emergency operations if needed.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Cycle Structure

* Each cycle consists of a fixed number of snapshots (default 14).
* Each snapshot occurs after a set number of Bitcoin blocks (default 150).
* The total cycle length is thus 2100 Bitcoin blocks by default (14 snapshots × 150 blocks).
* These defaults can be adjusted for production environments (e.g., 1 snapshot per day with appropriate block counts).

## Dual Stacking Formula

Weight Calculation:

$$
w_i = \cfrac{[B_i \cdot (1 + M \cdot \sqrt{r_i})]}{n}
$$

Where:

* _w_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= weight for user i_
* _B_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= sBTC balance of user i (sum across all snapshots)_
* _M = yield boost multiplier (default 9, meaning max boost of 10x)_
* _r_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= min(d_<sub>_i_</sub>_/D, 1), the ratio adjustment factor_
* _d_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= S_<sub>_i_</sub>_/B_<sub>_i_</sub>_, user's personal STX/sBTC ratio_
* _S_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= STX stacked by user i (sum across all snapshots)_
* _D = golden ratio (95th percentile STX/sBTC ratio across all participants)_
* _n = number of snapshots per cycle (default 14)_

Rewards Distribution:

$$
R_i = (\frac{w_i}{Σw}) \cdot Total Rewards
$$

Where:

* _R_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= reward for user i_
* _Σw = sum of all participant weights_
* _Total Rewards = min(pool balance, APR-based cap)_

Key Properties:

* _Participants with d_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;≥ D receive maximum boost of (M+1) x (default 10x)._
* _Participants with d_<sub>_i_</sub>_&#x20;= 0 (no STX stacked) receive base rewards (1x)._
* _Boost scales with the square root of the ratio for intermediate values._
* _Whitelisted DeFi tracking addresses automatically receive maximum boost without needing to stack STX._
* _Weights are divided by the number of snapshots per cycle to normalize across the cycle duration._

***

## Cycle Workflow

The Dual Stacking smart contract operates in cycles, each divided into snapshots. The process ensures accurate reward distribution through a series of permissionless operations that anyone can execute.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Snapshot Phase (Anyone Can Execute)

* capture-snapshot-balances: Anyone can capture balances for enrolled users after each snapshot.
* advance-to-next-snapshot: Anyone can transition to the next snapshot.
* finalize-snapshots: Anyone can conclude all snapshot data after the final snapshot.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Ratio Validation Phase (Competitive & Permissionless)

* propose-golden-ratio: Anyone can propose a golden ratio.
* tally-participant-ratios: The proposer tallies participant ratios relative to their proposed ratio.
* validate-ratio: The proposer validates their proposal — succeeds only if it represents the 95th percentile.
* Multiple proposals can be submitted; the first valid one locks in for the cycle.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Weight Computation Phase (Anyone Can Execute)

* calculate-participant-weights: Anyone can calculate participant weights using the dual stacking formula.
* finalize-weight-computation: Anyone can finalize weight computation.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reward Distribution Phase (Anyone Can Execute)

* set-is-distribution-enabled: Anyone can enable reward distribution by determining the available reward pool.
* distribute-rewards: Anyone can distribute rewards to enrolled users based on their weights.
* finalize-reward-distribution: Anyone can finalize reward distribution after all participants are rewarded.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Cycle Transition (Anyone Can Execute)

* advance-to-next-cycle: Anyone can advance to the next cycle after all rewards are distributed.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Note: All operations read data directly from the blockchain (sBTC balances from the sBTC token contract, STX stacking from native Stacks protocol). No off-chain data sources or trusted intermediaries are required.
