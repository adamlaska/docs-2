3. **Use in DeFi** â†’ Deploy sBTC across protocols while still earning rewards.
4. **Earn sBTC** â†’ and redeem 1:1 for BTC anytime.

PS: your stacked STX continues to earn bitcoin while in dual stacking.

### Dual Stacking Web App

The [Dual Stacking Web App](https://app.stacks.co/) is the primary user interface for participating in Dual Stacking â€” a mechanism that allows Bitcoin holders to earn BTC-denominated rewards through sBTC, and maximize those rewards by either stacking STX or using sBTC in DeFi.

{% hint style="info" %}
The minimum to mint sBTC via the sBTC Bridge app is currently at 0.001 BTC (100,000 sats).

The minimum to enroll in Dual Stacking with your minted sBTC will be 0.0001 sBTC (10,000 sats).
{% endhint %}

Once connected to the web app, you'll see the dashboard that lays out all the metrics regarding your rewards composition and different methods for boosting rewards. Track your balances, rewards and payouts at anytime.

The 'Boost your rewards' section will layout the steps for you to enroll and boost your rewards. All rewards are distributed in sBTC, redeemable 1:1 for BTC anytime.
