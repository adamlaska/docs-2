### Start Earning Bitcoin on Your Bitcoin

Until now, earning Bitcoin on your Bitcoin wasn't an option. Ethereum can't do it. Solana can't do it. Other Bitcoin Layer 2s can't do it.

Only Stacks can—and here's why.

Other blockchains have no mechanism to channel real Bitcoin to participants. They can only pay you in what they mint. Stacks is the only blockchain with [Proof of Transfer (PoX)](https://docs.stacks.co/concepts/stacks-101/proof-of-transfer)—a consensus mechanism that directly channels Bitcoin from miners to participants who secure the network.

This isn't theoretical. PoX has been operational since 2021, moving over 4,000 Bitcoin onchain through consensus.

Dual Stacking is the first product to unlock what PoX makes possible: Bitcoin in → Bitcoin out.

### Why This Matters

Bitcoin is pristine collateral worth trillions, yet the majority remains untapped as a productive asset. Despite massive demand for Bitcoin yield, current solutions break Bitcoin's core promises:

* Custodial lending → Reintroduces trust and third-party risk
* Fragmented liquidity → Multiple BTC-pegged assets reduce efficiency for builders
* Alt-token rewards → Not what Bitcoin holders want

Dual Stacking solves this.

### Introducing Dual Stacking

Dual Stacking enables Bitcoin holders to earn BTC-denominated rewards paid in [sBTC](http://stacks.co/sbtc)— no points, no nonsense. Real Bitcoin, flowing through Stacks' Proof of Transfer consensus.

This is something that has never existed in DeFi. Here's how it works:

**1. Mint sBTC & Enroll**

Peg in BTC to sBTC through the [sBTC bridge](https://app.stacks.co/) (where it remains 1:1 Bitcoin-backed at all times). Enroll in Dual Stacking to start earning base Bitcoin-denominated yield in sBTC.

**2. Boost Rewards by Stacking STX**&#x20;

Stack STX alongside your sBTC to multiply returns up to 10x. The more STX you commit, the higher the rewards on your Bitcoin, plus the more additional BTC you earn from your STX stacking.

**3. Boost Rewards with DeFi**&#x20;

Simultaneously use your sBTC across Stacks protocols while still earning yield..

**4. Get paid in sBTC**

All rewards are distributed in sBTC, redeemable 1:1 for BTC anytime.

### Real Rewards, Flexible Options

As more BTC enters the Stacks network, rates will adjust. But the multiplier effect remains: pairing STX with your BTC always amplifies your returns.

At the time of writing, current rates are sitting at:

* **Stack sBTC only**: Up to .5% APY in sBTC
* **Stack sBTC & STX**: Up to 5% APY on sBTC
* **Additionally**: STX earns standard stacking rewards (\~9% APY) in BTC

**How the Boost Works:** You can boost your rewards through Stacking STX and deploying into DeFi.&#x20;

Your Bitcoin rewards grow based on your STX-to-sBTC ratio relative to other participants. The system uses a square-root curve, meaning your first stacked STX has the greatest impact, with smaller boosts as you add more.

Even a small amount of STX can go a long way. Stacking STX worth just 1–2% of your sBTC’s value can boost your rewards to about 2%. The highest boosters, meaning participants with the strongest STX/sBTC ratios, can earn up to 10× the base yield.

At the same time, your stacked STX continues earning standard stacking rewards (\~9% APY) so you’re earning on both sides.

This model aligns incentives across the network: More Bitcoin capital → More liquidity for Bitcoin DeFi → Stronger Stacks ecosystem → Better yields for everyone.

### What Makes This So Secure

**Trust-Minimized by Design**

sBTC is secured by a decentralized signer network using threshold-signature consensus. Signers cannot arbitrarily redirect funds. They can only co-sign transactions that conform to predefined contract logic.

**Battle-Tested Infrastructure**

The signer network has been operational since December 2024, processing real Bitcoin transactions through threshold signatures. Each transaction is authorized collectively, eliminating single-operator risk.

**DeFi Composability Without Compromise**

Deploy sBTC across Stacks protocols while earning Dual Stacking yield—something impossible on other chains without custodial intermediaries.

### Why This Changes Everything

For Bitcoiners, this solves the fundamental tradeoff between custody and productivity. You no longer choose between earning on your Bitcoin OR maintaining security. You get both.

For the Stacks ecosystem, this positions sBTC as the canonical Bitcoin liquidity layer. It eliminates fragmentation and creates network effects that benefit every protocol builder.

For crypto broadly, this proves Bitcoin can be productive capital while respecting Bitcoin's ethos. No custody compromises. No synthetic derivatives. Just Bitcoin earning Bitcoin.
