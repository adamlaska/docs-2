Dual Stacking enables Bitcoin holders to earn Bitcoin-denominated rewards through Stacks' Proof of Transfer consensus. (link to PoX docs page) Rewards are paid in sBTC (link to sBTC docs page).\
\
Dual Stacking is the only way to earn Bitcoin rewards while stacking Bitcoin. Other blockchains pay rewards in what they can mint (ETH, SOL, etc.). They have no mechanism to channel real Bitcoin. **Stacks has Proof of Transfer (PoX)** is the architectural difference that makes Bitcoin earning Bitcoin rewards possible.\
\
As more BTC enters the Stacks network, rates will adjust. But the multiplier effect remains: pairing STX with your BTC and deploying sBTC into DeFi always amplify your returns.
